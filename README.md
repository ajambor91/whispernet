A secure and anonymous peer-to-peer chat platform.
</h2> 

WhisperNet is a decentralized communication platform designed to provide private and real-time messaging between users. The project is built on a microservices architecture, ensuring scalability, modularity, and fault tolerance.

---

## Features

- **Decentralized Communication**: Peer-to-peer sessions using WebRTC.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Powered by Spring Boot, Node.js, and Kafka.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Includes Grafana, Loki, and Promtail for application logs and metrics.
- **Cross-Platform**: Frontend built in React.
- **WebRTC**: Session signaling with a test TURN server.
- **WebAssembly**: Message sanitizing and AES 256 encoding and decoding for higher security and customizability.
- **PGP Authorization**: Signing and requiring session signatures from receivers.

### Component Descriptions

- **Frontend (React)**:  
  Users interact with the chat application and communicate directly with the Signal-Server for WebRTC signaling.

- **Session (Spring Boot)**:  
  Handles user creation and sends messages to WSSession via Kafka. Optionally interacts with Redis for temporary data storage.

- **WSSession (Spring Boot)**:  
  Manages WebSocket sessions, interacts with Redis for session data, and sends messages to Signal-Server via Kafka.

- **Security (Spring Boot)**
  Manages users resister, login, and verification

- **Signal-Server (Node.js)**:  
  Handles WebRTC signaling and connects directly to the frontend. Optionally interacts with Redis for connection state management.
- **Approving Server (Node.js)**:
  Informs users that their connection request has been accepted.
- **Kafka**:  
  Acts as a reliable messaging bus between all microservices.

- **Redis**:  
  Serves as a fast in-memory store for session data and temporary states.

- **Security Redis**:
  Stores currently verified or waiting for verifying users
- **Security DB**:
  Stores users PGP Key for identity verification

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js and npm
- Java 17+ for Spring Boot (included in docker)
- Redis (included in Docker)
- PHP 8.2 and composer (included in docker)

---

### Steps to Run Locally

### Dev environment
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ajambor91/whispernet.git
   cd whispernet
   ```
2. **Generate ssl server.crt and server.key files and replace server_dummy files in nginx directory**
3. **Genereate JWT token and replace login.jwt.secret in net.whisper.security/cfg/application.properties**
4. **For CMS move to /cms/project_root/whispernet-cms and copy .env.local and remove .local suffix then run composer install, CMS is not requried to run main application**
5. **Run containers stack**
    ```bash
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up -d
   ```
6. **Run frontend app**
    ```bash
    cd ui
    npm install or yarn install *
    cd ui/wb
    npm run dev
    
7. **Run CMS frontend**
    ```bash
   cd ui
   npm install or yarn install *
   cd ui/cms
   npm run dev

* *You only need to run one install command in the main ui directory

Open http://localhost:3200 in web browser for main application.
Open http://localhost:3100 in web browser for cms frontend.
Open http://localhost:8099/cms/dashboard for administrator panel

cms-db directory contains example data for cms and example user with credentials test@teest.test, altough you can create your own user running from dir in cms service or (if you have php installed) in cms project root on your host machine

```bash
   php bin/console app:make-admin email@domain.example examplePassword
```
MariaDB instance in cms-db service has two example users - root and exampleUser, both has password 3x@mplePassword. All services has example configs and SSL keys.

### Local test environment
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ajambor91/whispernet.git
   cd whispernet
   ```
2. **Generate ssl server.crt and server.key files and replace server_dummy files in nginx directory**
3. **Genereate JWT token and replace login.jwt.secret in net.whisper.security/cfg/application.properties.local**
4. **Copy nginx.example.conf from nginx-host directory, or create similar configuration for nginx or apache**
5. **Generate your SSL certificates and replace whispernet_dummy and chat-whispernet_dummy with the new ones. Then, remove the _dummy suffix from the file names.**
6. **Run containers stack**
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.local-frontend.yml build
    docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.local-frontend.yml up -d
   ```
Open your web browser with https://whispernet.local for main page or https://chat.whispernet.local, frontend for both cms and app is included in docker
***SSL is required for the app because user tokens, needed to connect sessions, are stored in secure cookies only***

### QA Environment
You can also use QA Environment. You should reneme all Dockerfile.example.qa in their respective dirs and create configs by duplicating existing *.example.* files and renaming them (e.g., redis.example.qa.conf â†’ redis.qa.conf), and make all steps from Local test environment like generating SSL or JWT. Adjust the values as needed. QA Environments is similar to Local Test
Then run:
```bash
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.qa.yml build
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.qa.yml up -d
```
In this version you have to set loki data source in grafana as http://loki:3100, in CMS you should create your admin in CMS container: php bin/console app:make-admin login@domain.example password, and next create your content in dashboard.

### Production Envrionment
This environment has similar requirment as QA environments, you should replace all Dockerfile.prod and all config files, but containers and configs are production-ready optimized. In this stack you have to type your domain in cms frontend .env files and type it into nginx-host configuration.
```bash
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.prod.yml build
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### Monitoring - Grafana

Open your web browser and type http://localhost:3000. Example credentials are user: admin, password: examplePassword; apps to explore are:
- wssession 
- session
- websocket
- security
- frontend
- gateway
- kafka


## Test Coverage

Currently, tests have been implemented for the **Session-Service** microservice, with the following coverage statistics:

| Service              | Test Coverage  | Notes                                                      |
|----------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Session-Service**  | 88%            | Mostly integration or hybrid tests completed using Jacoco. |
| **WSSession**        | 91%            | Mostly integration or hybrid tests completed using Jacoco. |
| **Security**         | Not yet testet | Planned for future coverage.                               |
| **Signal-Server**    | Not yet tested | Planned for future coverage.                               |
| **Approving-Server** | Not yet tested | Planned for future coverage.                               |


### Coverage Report

The coverage report for **Session-Service** has been generated using [Jacoco](https://www.jacoco.org/).  
You can find the HTML report in the `target/site/jacoco` directory or access it via the link below:

- [WSSession-Service Coverage Report](https://ajambor91.github.io/whispernet/reports/wssession/jacoco/test/html/index.html)
### Notes



### Notes
*   **Demo (main branch):**  A demo of peer identity verification using PGP keys is available on the `main` branch.  You can force a session to walk through the verification process and connect to the Approving Server.
*   **Production (release/0.1.1):** The current production version resides on the `release/0.1.1` branch.

## In progress
1. **Finishing PGP signing sessions flow**
2. **Security service testing**
